# There is currently an issue with the deployed application. When run on my local client the application works fine and the JavaScript executes perfectly. If you clone the files to your local client it will work as intended as well. However when i push the same exact code to github, the deployed application will not execute some of the JavaScript functions i.e (loading current date and executing the savehandler to local storage).




# Challenge-5


This is the fifth challenge of my UW coding bootcamp curriculum.

For this challenge, we had to follow the acceptance criteria to create a daily scheduler using moment.js
The user is given the option to enter any text they desire in the hourly timeblocks set from 9 AM to 5 PM.
If the user presses the save button, the text will be saved to local storage and persist on page re-load.

This code was developed using starter code. Bootstrap was used for the HTML. Moment.JS and jquery were used for the JavaScript
